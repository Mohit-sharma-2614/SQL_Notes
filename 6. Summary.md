You can now read from a database using `SELECT` statements, including `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` clauses to filter results. You also learned about frequently used aggregate functions, the `DISTINCT` keyword to specify unique results, and the `LIKE` keyword to perform a text search on the values in a column. Finally, you learned how to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` rows in a data table.

```SQL
SELECT Columns or aggregate fuctions FROM Table_name
WHERE Conditions
GROUP BY Columns
ORDER BY Column_name Sort_order
LIMIT Number of rows;
```
