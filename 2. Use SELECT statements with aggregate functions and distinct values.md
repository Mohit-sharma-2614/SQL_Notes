The `email` table has 7 columns:

- `id`: The primary key.
- `subject`: The subject line of the email.
- `sender`: The email address from which the email originated.
- `folder`: The folder where the message can be found, such as Inbox or Spam.
- `starred`: Whether or not the user starred the email.
- `read`: Whether or not the user read the email.
- `received`: The timestamp when the email was received.

Examples of SQL aggregate functions include the following:

- `COUNT()`: Returns the total number of rows that match the query.
- `SUM()`: Returns the sum of the values for all rows in the selected column.
- `AVG()`: Returns the mean value—average—of all the values in the selected column.
- `MIN()`: Returns the smallest value in the selected column.
- `MAX()`: Returns the largest value in the selected column.

**Syntax**
SELECT Aggregate_function ( Column_name ) FROM table_name;
ex:-
```SQL
SELECT MAX(reveived) FROM email;
```

#### Filter duplicate results with `DISTINCT`
Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
ex:-
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT sender FROM email;
```
****You can also precede the column name in an aggregate function with the `DISTINCT` keyword.****
```SQL
SELECT Aggregate_function ( DISTINCT Column_name ) FROM Table_name;
```
ex:-
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender) FROM email;
```
