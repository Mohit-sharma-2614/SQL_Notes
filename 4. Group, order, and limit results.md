The `email` table has 7 columns:

- `id`: The primary key.
- `subject`: The subject line of the email.
- `sender`: The email address from which the email originated.
- `folder`: The folder where the message can be found, such as Inbox or Spam.
- `starred`: Whether or not the user starred the email.
- `read`: Whether or not the user read the email.
- `received`: The timestamp when the email was received.

## Group results with `GROUP BY`
You can use a `GROUP BY` clause to group results so that all rows that have the same value for a given column are grouped next to each other in the results. This clause doesn't change the results, but only the order in which they're returned.

To add a `GROUP BY` clause to a `SELECT` statement, add the `GROUP BY` keyword followed by the column name you want to group results by.

```SQL
GROUP BY Column_name
```
A common use case is to couple a `GROUP BY` clause with an aggregate function to partition the result of the aggregate function across different buckets, such as values of a column. Here's an example. Pretend you want to get the number of emails in each folder: `'inbox'`, `'spam'`, etc. You can select both the `folder` column and the `COUNT()` aggregate function, and specify the `folder` column in the `GROUP BY` clause.

Perform the following query to select the folder column, and the result of `COUNT()` aggregate function. Use a `GROUP BY` clause to bucket the results by the value in the `folder` column.
```SQL 
SELECT folder, COUNT(*) FROM email GROUP BY folder;
```
The query returns the total number of emails for each folder

## Sort results with `ORDER BY`
You can also change the order of query results when you sort them with the `ORDER BY` clause. Add the `ORDER BY` keyword, followed by a column name, followed by the sort direction.

```SQL
ORDER BY Column_name Sort_direction;
```
By default, the sort direction is `a`scending order, which you can omit from the `ORDER BY` clause. If you want the results sorted in descending order, add `DESC` after the column name.

**Example**
```SQL
SELECT * FROM email ORDER BY received DESC;
```
shows recent emails firstly.

## Select all emails where the subject contains the text "fool" and sort the results in ascending order. Because the order is ascending, which is the default order when none is specified, using the `ASC` keyword with the `ORDER BY` clause is optional.
```SQL 
SELECT * FROM email WHERE subject LIKE '%fool%' ORDER BY received ASC;
```

`Note: If both are used in the same query, the `GROUP BY` clause comes before the `ORDER BY` clause.`

## Restrict the number of results with `LIMIT`
**Syntax**
```SQL
LIMIT Max rows to return;
```
or 
```SQL
LIMIT Max rows to return OFFSET Rows to skip;
```

**Example**
. This query will show the starting 10 emails only.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM email WHERE folder = 'inbox' ORDER BY received DESC LIMIT 10;
```
. The query returns ten results in decreasing order. However, the query skips the first set of ten results.
```SQL 
SELECT * FROM email WHERE folder = 'inbox' 
ORDER BY recieved DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```
