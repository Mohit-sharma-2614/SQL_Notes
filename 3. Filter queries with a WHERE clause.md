The `email` table has 7 columns:

- `id`: The primary key.
- `subject`: The subject line of the email.
- `sender`: The email address from which the email originated.
- `folder`: The folder where the message can be found, such as Inbox or Spam.
- `starred`: Whether or not the user starred the email.
- `read`: Whether or not the user read the email.
- `received`: The timestamp when the email was received.


Syntax
```SQL
SELECT Columns or aggregate functions FROM Table_name WHERE Conditions;
```
Example:-
```SQL
SELECT * FROM email WHERE folder = 'inbox';
```
**## Logical operators with `WHERE` clauses**
SQL `WHERE` clauses aren't limited to a single expression. You can use the `AND` keyword, equivalent to the Kotlin **and** operator (`&&`), to only include results that satisfy both conditions.
Syntax
```SQL
WHERE First_Condition AND Second_condition;
```
Alternatively, you can use the `OR` keyword, equivalent to the Kotlin **or** operator (`||`), to include rows in the results that satisfy either condition.
**Syntax**
```SQL
WHERE First_Condition OR Second_Condition;
```
For readability, you can also negate an expression using the `NOT` keyword.
**Syntax**
```SQL
WHERE NOT Condition
```

**Example**
```SQL
SELECT * FROM email WHERE folder = 'inbox' AND read = false;
```


**## Search for text using `LIKE`**
One super useful thing you can do with a `WHERE` clause is to search for text in a specific column. You achieve this result when you specify a column name, followed by the `LIKE` keyword, followed by a search string.

**Syntax**
```SQL
WHERE Column_name LIKE '% Search_String %';
```
If you're searching for a prefix—results that begin with the specified text—omit the first percent symbol (`%`).
```SQL
WHERE Column_name LIKE 'Search_String%';
```
Alternatively, if you're searching for a suffix, omit the last percent symbol (`%`).
```SQL
WHERE Column_name LIKE '% Search_String';
```

**Example**
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email WHERE subject LIKE '%fool%'
```

```SQL
// this will reutrn all sender whoes name starts with h
SELECT DISTINCT sender FROM email WHERE sender LIKE 'h%'
```
